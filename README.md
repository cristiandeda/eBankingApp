# eBankingApp

- project developed during the **Object-Oriented Programming** course in my second year at *University Politehnica of Bucharest*, *Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers*.

- this project is similar to a system for banking accounts management in an EBanking App
- implemented the possibility for each user to have *different currency accounts*, *stocks portofolio*, as well as *friends* to *transfer*/*receive* money *to*/*from*;
- used design patterns such as:
    - `Singleton` and `Facade` for the **database**
    - `Strategy` for **exchanges**
    - `Factory` for **multiple currency account management**
